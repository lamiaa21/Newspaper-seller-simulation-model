1. Overview of the Problem:
   The goal is to decide how many newspapers to buy each day based on uncertain demand. There are four possible types of days (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor), with each having a distinct probability and demand distribution. The challenge is to balance the cost of newspapers, revenue from sales, lost profit from unmet demand, and salvage value of unsold papers.

2. Key Functional Components:
   Type of Newsday Generation: The generate_type() function uses random numbers (0-100) to classify the day into one of four categories:

'E' (Excellent)
'G' (Good)
'F' (Fair)
'P' (Poor)
Demand Generation: Each type of newsday has its own demand distribution, implemented with functions like:

generate_ex() (for Excellent days)
generate_go() (for Good days)
generate_fa() (for Fair days)
generate_po() (for Poor days)
Profit Calculation: Daily profit is calculated as:

# Daily Profit

Revenue
−
Cost
−
Lost Profit

- Salvage Value
  Daily Profit=Revenue−Cost−Lost Profit+Salvage Value

3. Structure of the Simulation:
   Input Parameters:

Number of days (n)
Purchase price (price_P)
Selling price (price_S)
Scrap value for unsold papers (scrap)
Simulation Loop:

For each purchase quantity (40, 60, 80, …, 140):
Simulate sales for each day, with random assignment of day types and demands.
Track revenues, costs, lost profits, and salvage values.
Store daily and total profits for later comparison.
Optimal Purchase Calculation:

After simulating multiple purchase quantities, the code finds the purchase quantity that yields the maximum total profit. 4. Performance Enhancements & Fixes:
Lost Profit Fix:

python
Copy code
lostP_x.append((demand[j] - i) \* price_S) # Use selling price for lost profit
Ensures that the lost profit is calculated based on the selling price, not the purchase price.

Profit Calculation for Each Bundle: At the end of each purchase quantity simulation, it prints:

Total profit
Average daily profit 5. Graphs and Visualizations:
The code includes commented-out graphing functionality using matplotlib. You can uncomment these sections to visualize:

Distribution of newsdays
Demand patterns
Lost profit from unmet demand
Salvage values
Daily profits over time 6. How Scrap and Selling Prices Affect the Solution:
At the end of the simulation, the user inputs increases in the selling and scrap prices, which impact future simulations by:

Increasing the potential revenue per sale
Increasing the salvage value of unsold papers
This allows users to see how profitability changes when these parameters are adjusted.

7. Final Results and Plotting:
   Optimal Quantity: The code identifies the optimal purchase quantity that maximizes profits.
   Graphs:
   Line plot: Showing the relationship between purchase quantity and profit.
   Bar plot: Showing the optimal purchase quantity for maximum profit.
8. Suggestions for Improvement:
   User Interface Improvements:

Add validations for user inputs (e.g., ensure prices are positive).
Provide more detailed output summaries.
Data Export: Save results (profits, demand patterns) to a CSV file for further analysis.

Modularization: Split the simulation into functions to make the code more maintainable.

9. Example Run (Sample Output):
   yaml
   Copy code
   Enter number of days: 10
   Enter Purchase Price: 0.5
   Enter Sell Price: 0.7
   Enter Scrap Price: 0.15

for purchase: 40
sum profit: 32.00
average profit: 3.20

for purchase: 60
sum profit: 36.50
average profit: 3.65

...

the max profit: 42.50
the optimal number of newspaper that the seller should purchase is: 100
